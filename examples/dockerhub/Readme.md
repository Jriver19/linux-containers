# Dockerhub
Dockerhub is a multi-tenant Jupyter notebook server.  The image for it is assembled
from several Jupyter components that provide user authentication and access to
individual Jupyter notebook server instances dedicated to each user's work.

Details about how to build this image and deploy containers from it are coming
soon.
